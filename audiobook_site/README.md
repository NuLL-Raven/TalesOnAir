# Audiobook and PDF Books Website

## Overview

This project is a Django-based web application designed to create a platform for users to access audiobooks and PDF books. It features functionalities like user authentication, subscription plans, and personalized recommendations based on user preferences. The website includes features like sign-up/sign-in, user profile management, subscription management, and a clean and intuitive home page.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out using either their username or email and password.
- **Subscription Plans**: The application includes subscription plans such as Free, Basic, and Premium. Users can select a plan at sign-up and enjoy benefits based on their subscription.
- **Book Catalog**: Users can view available books by genre, search, and filter through the catalog.
- **Personal Playlists**: Users can create and manage their own playlists by adding books to them.
- **Genre-based Sorting**: Books are categorized by genre, allowing users to explore different types of content.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Database Management**: The project uses a relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store information about users, books, subscriptions, and playlists.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (or PostgreSQL in production)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication system, customized to support logging in with either username or email.
- **Forms**: Django Forms for user input handling (sign up, sign in, etc.)

## Models

### `User`

The custom `User` model inherits from Django's `AbstractUser` and includes a foreign key to the `Subscription` model.

```python
class User(AbstractUser):
    subscription = models.ForeignKey('Subscription', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
```

### `Subscription`

This model defines different subscription plans (Free, Basic, Premium), including their prices and durations.

```python
class Subscription(models.Model):
    SUBSCRIPTION_TYPES = [
        ('FREE', 'Free'),
        ('BASIC', 'Basic'),
        ('PREMIUM', 'Premium'),
    ]
    subscription_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    type = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=SUBSCRIPTION_TYPES)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
```

### `Book`

This model stores information about books, including title, author, genre, and availability in audio format.

```python
class Book(models.Model):
    book_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    genre = models.ForeignKey(Genre, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    audio_availability = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

## Views

### `sign_up` and `sign_in` Views

These views handle user registration and login, including custom validation for username/email login.

```python
def sign_up(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.save()
            subscription = Subscription.objects.get(type='FREE')
            user.subscription = subscription
            user.save()
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('home')
```

```python
def sign_in(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = AuthenticationForm(request, data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            user = form.get_user()
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('home')
```
